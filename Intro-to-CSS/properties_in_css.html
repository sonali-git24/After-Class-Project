      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style HTML elements
      on a web page. It controls the appearance of content, including layout,
      colors, fonts, spacing, and more. The basic syntax of CSS consists of
      selectors and declarations. A selector targets an HTML element, and
      declarations are written inside curly braces as property-value pairs
      (e.g., color: blue;). There are different types of selectors: element
      selectors like p, class selectors using a period (e.g., .container), and

      Understanding the CSS box model is essentialâ€”it describes how margin,
      border, padding, and content make up the layout of an element. You can
      also set background images using background-image and make your pages
      responsive with media queries like @media (max-width: 600px) to apply
      styles on smaller screens. A simple CSS example would involve changing the
      background color of the body, setting a specific font, and customizing
      text color and size for headings and paragraphs. With practice, CSS allows
      you to create beautifully styled, responsive, and user-friendly web pages.
